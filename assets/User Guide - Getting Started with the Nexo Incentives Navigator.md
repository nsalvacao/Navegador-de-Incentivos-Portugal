## Introduction: Your Guide to Funding Opportunities

Welcome to the Nexo Incentives Navigator, a specialized AI assistant designed to help Portuguese companies discover and understand national and EU funding opportunities, including grants, tax benefits, and employment support schemes. Its core purpose is to translate complex information into clear, actionable insights, simplifying your search for the right incentive for your project.

#### Who is this guide for?

This guide is for professionals seeking to leverage public and private funding. See how the Navigator can help your specific role:

- **SME Owners and Managers:** Gain a clear, realistic overview of available funding ("what is on the table") for a specific investment or project.
- **CFOs and Finance Teams:** Map various funding options—including grants, tax incentives, and EU programmes—to support strategic financial planning and investment decisions.
- **Consultants and Advisors:** Get a fast, structured initial analysis of potential incentives before committing to in-depth project design and application writing.
- **Public Sector & Ecosystem Actors:** Explore practical ways companies can combine different national and EU financial instruments to maximize project impact.

**CRITICAL DISCLAIMER** This assistant is a decision-support and discovery tool. It does **not** provide legal, tax, or accounting advice, and it does not guarantee the approval of any application. Final decisions and official interpretations belong solely to the competent authorities and your qualified professional advisers.

Now that you understand its purpose, let's explore how the Navigator turns vast amounts of information into tailored insights.

### 1. How the Navigator Works: From Information to Insight

The Nexo Incentives Navigator uses a two-part methodology to provide reliable and up-to-date answers. It begins by reasoning over a **curated knowledge base** of official documents covering the last decade of Portuguese and EU incentives. Then, it performs **live web checks** against official sources to confirm dates, application statuses, and other critical details. This approach ensures that its answers are grounded in official documentation while also reflecting the latest updates.

#### What kind of incentives does it cover?

The Navigator's knowledge base is focused on business-oriented support programmes. Here is a summary of the main categories it covers:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Incentive Category|Examples|
|**PRR (Recovery and Resilience Plan)**|Agendas, Empresas 4.0, decarbonisation, capitalisation schemes|
|**Portugal 2020 / 2030**|COMPETE, regional programmes, thematic programmes|
|**Tax Incentives**|SIFIDE, RFAI, contractual benefits, capitalisation schemes|
|**Employment and Training**|IEFP support, internships, hiring incentives|
|**Direct EU Programmes**|Horizon Europe, EIC, LIFE, Digital Europe, Single Market Programme|

#### Conservative by Design

The assistant operates with a set of "conservative guardrails" to ensure the information it provides is responsible and safe for decision-making. These principles are:

- **Fact-Based:** The assistant does not invent rates, deadlines, or funding amounts. All figures are based on the information retrieved from its knowledge base or official websites.
- **No Guarantees:** It will never promise or imply that an application will be approved, maintaining a clear line between providing information and making false assurances.
- **Clear Timelines:** It explicitly separates currently active programmes from historical or closed instruments, **preventing you from wasting time on opportunities that are no longer available.**
- **Source-Driven:** The assistant consistently recommends that you confirm all details with official sources and provides links to do so, promoting verification and due diligence.

With this understanding of how the tool works, you are ready to begin crafting your first effective query.

### 2. Getting Started: Crafting Your First Effective Query

Getting started is a straightforward process. Simply **access the assistant** and follow these two key steps to get your recommendations:

1. **Describe Your Needs** In your own words, describe your company and your project. The more context you provide, the better the recommendations will be. If needed, the assistant may ask a few clarifying questions.
2. **Get Recommendations** The assistant will analyze your request and propose relevant programmes or incentives, highlighting key eligibility criteria and practical next steps.

#### Pro Tip: The Recipe for a Powerful Prompt

To get the most accurate and helpful response, structure your initial query to include three essential pieces of information:

- **Your Company:** Briefly describe its size (SME, large enterprise), business sector, and general location within Portugal.
- **Your Project:** Explain the type of investment or initiative you are planning. Examples include R&D, digitalisation, international expansion, hiring new staff, training, or decarbonisation efforts.
- **Your Budget:** Provide a rough estimate or range for the project's budget. This helps the assistant filter for programmes with appropriate funding thresholds.

Once you submit your query, the assistant will provide a structured response designed for clarity. Here’s how to interpret it.

### 3. Understanding the Assistant's Response: A Structured Approach

The Navigator's answers are intentionally structured to help you make decisions, not just to present a list of links. Each response follows a logical flow, guiding you from a high-level overview to specific, actionable advice.

#### The Anatomy of an Answer

Here are the key components you will find in a typical response and what to look for in each:

1. **Context and High-Level Explanation** This is the "big picture" overview. It sets the scene by explaining the general landscape of incentives relevant to your query before diving into specifics.
2. **Relevant Programmes/Options** This section lists the specific funding lines or tax benefits that appear to match your needs. This is the core of the recommendation.
3. **Eligibility and Main Conditions** Pay close attention here. This part outlines the key requirements your company and project must meet to be considered eligible for each recommended programme.
4. **State of Play (Open / Planned / Closed / Historical)** This tells you the current status of the application period. The Navigator may also reference historical programs to provide context or for comparison with active incentives.
5. **Links to Official Sources** Crucially, the assistant provides direct links to the official government or EU portals (e.g., portugal2030.pt, iapmei.pt). Use these links to verify all information.
6. **Concrete Next Steps** Finally, the response gives you actionable advice on what to do next, such as preparing specific documentation, contacting a particular agency, or discussing the options with your team.

**Expert Note:** While all sections are important, pay special attention to the **Concrete Next Steps**. This is where the assistant translates information into an actionable plan, telling you exactly what to do to move forward.

This structured information is a powerful starting point. To use it effectively, it is essential to follow some key best practices for verification.

### 4. Best Practices: Ensuring Accuracy and Reliability

To get the most value from the Nexo Incentives Navigator, it is vital to understand its role and limitations.

#### A Powerful Support Tool, Not a Replacement

The assistant is a powerful starting point for discovery and initial analysis. However, it is **not** a substitute for professional judgment or direct communication with managing authorities. Specifically, it does not replace:

- ❌ Legal opinions
- ❌ Tax advice
- ❌ Accounting or audit work
- ❌ Direct contact with managing authorities (like IAPMEI, AD&C, etc.)

#### Your Verification Checklist: The 3 Non-Negotiables

The AI can make mistakes. Before making any final decisions based on the information provided, you should **always** follow these three essential verification steps:

1. ✅ **Check the Official Source** Always click the provided links and verify the deadlines, funding rates, and eligibility criteria against the latest official call for applications or legal notice. Official documentation is the single source of truth.
2. ✅ **Ask the Relevant Authority** If you have any doubts or need clarification on a specific rule, contact the relevant managing authority directly. Entities like IAPMEI, AD&C, IEFP, ANI, AICEP, etc., are there to answer applicant questions.
3. ✅ **Consult Your Professionals** Discuss the findings and potential opportunities with your accountant, lawyer, or a specialized funding consultant. They can provide tailored advice based on your company's specific financial and legal situation.

By using the Navigator as an intelligent starting point and following these best practices, you can explore Portugal's funding landscape with confidence. Happy navigating!
